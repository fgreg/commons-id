  <p>
     This package contains factories and implementation classes to generate unique
     identifiers.</p>
  <p>
     The implementation is divided into the following subpackages.
     <ul>
     <li>The main package contains uid interface definitions, abstract base
     classes for identifier generators, generator factories and an
     IdentifierUtils convenience class that maintains singleton generators and 
     exposes static methods for generating identifiers of the various kinds.</li>
     
     <li>The <code>random</code> subpackage contains implementations of
     generators that return identifiers that appear to be random.</li>

     <li>The <code>serial</code> subpackage contains generators that yield
     sequences of identifiers that follow a regular sequence (e.g., increasing
     numeric values).</li>
     
     <li>The <code>uuid</code> subpackage contains implementations of the 
     <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-01.txt">
     IETF Draft UUID specification</a></li>
     </ul>
