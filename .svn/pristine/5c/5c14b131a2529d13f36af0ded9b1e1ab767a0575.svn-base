      This package contains UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
      generator implementations and supporting classes. 
  </p>
  <p>
      A UUID is 128-bits long and can provide an extremely high likelihood
      of uniqueness. For more information see the Internet Engineering Task
      Force <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122:
      A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
     The version 1 uuid generator collaborates with various interfaces that 
     allow for custom implementations in solving some challenges relating to:
     where and how to retrieve the node identifier (usually the MAC-address), how
     to persist generator data, and how to resolve uuid timestamps. Default 
     implementations are provided in this package and sub-packages.
